# Chirpstack Simulator

## How to run

After the deployment of the infrastructure, you need to setup the jwt_token inside the config file. 

The jwt_token can be requested in chirpstack application server API.

To run the simulator, make sure the simulator does not exists in your current deployment.

```bash

kubectl delete pods/simulator && kubectl apply -k ./

```
